This isn't just a book; it's my story, poured from my soul. I've forged words to chart my journey, the path leading to what feels like an inescapable end, all while waging wars within the battlefields of my mind, desperately trying to balance life with the seductive allure of daydreaming.

I've always wondered how one truly defines 'life.' Is it the pursuit of happiness? The drive of motivation? The warmth of loved ones? The simple act of smiling? A kaleidoscope of emotions swirls within us, and yet, I struggle to capture its essence, to give it a name.

Perhaps my ideals and notions are, as some say, worthless. But they're the fragile threads that hold my sanity together. Even with Rias, there are aspects I know clash with those ideals, yet I choose to ignore them, because I'm too weak, too afraid to confront the truth.

I've always lived by the mantra that nothing lasts forever. I knew it would hold true for my imagined, fake scenarios, and I even cautioned myself against becoming too attached. Yet, in the end, I wasn't capable of facing what truly mattered. And now, I stand at that precipice, and I ask myself: am I strong enough to fight this? Or wait... is this a battle I even should fight?
